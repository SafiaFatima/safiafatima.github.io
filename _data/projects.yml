    - Exploring BRATS 2015 dataset containing MRI images of different tumor patients.
    - Using Deep Learning algorithm U-net to build a medical imaging pipeline for localization of 4 types of tumors on a given MRI slice.
    - Performing evaluation on 4 modalities of the MRI dataset for all the tumors.

  name: Data Dissemination for Bioinformatics - An Agent Migration Approach

    Final Year Capstone Project for the BS Computer Science
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - An agent migration approach to fill in the gap that existing approaches have not addressed: retrieving remote data in a low-quality network environment, especially unstable mobile computing environments and do the client-side computation on server end.
    - The ability of migration offers mobile agents a means to overcome the high latency or limited bandwidth problem by moving their computations to required resources or services. User will be able to see his/her activity graphically visualized logs and statistics on their smart phone screen.
    - The proposed approach can also overcome the resource limitation of mobile terminals and release mobile users from keeping online persistently
