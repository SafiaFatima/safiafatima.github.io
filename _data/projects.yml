    - A method that incorporates a deep learning-based model U-Net to address brain tumor localization.
    - Utilizing BRATS2015 as the primary dataset for Brain MRI Images.
    - Using the same architecture for the evaluation of individual modalities.
    - Presented and published in ICET'19 conference.

    - An agent migration approach to fill in the gap that existing approaches have not addressed: retrieving remote data in a low-quality network environment, especially unstable mobile computing environments and do the client-side computation on the server end.
    - The ability of migration offers mobile agents a means to overcome the high latency or limited bandwidth problem by moving their computations to required resources or services. Users will be able to see his/her activity graphically visualized logs and statistics on their smartphone screen.
    - The proposed approach can also overcome the resource limitation of mobile terminals and release mobile users from keeping online persistently.
